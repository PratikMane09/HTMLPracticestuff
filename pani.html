    <h1>Panipuri</h1>

    <p align ="left" text="white">1. Rinse 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ cup tightly packed mint leaves, 2 to 3 green chilies and 1 inch ginger very well in water a few times. Drain all the water.

        Peel the ginger and roughly chop it. Also chop the green chilies. Roughly chop the coriander leaves and mint leaves. Don’t use the stem of mint leaves as they can make the spiced water have a bitter taste. Only use the fresh mint leaves.
        
        herbs in a bowl<br>
        
        2. Add coriander leaves, mint leaves, ginger and green chili in a grinder or blender jar. For a less spicy pani you can add just 1 chopped green chilli.
        
        herbs added to grinder jar<br>
        
        3. Add 1 tablespoon tightly packed tamarind and 3.5 to 4 tablespoons jaggery powder or grated jaggery.
        
        If you do not have tamarind, then you can use 2 tablespoons lemon juice. You can also use equal amounts of jaggery and dates. So you can add 2 tablespoons crumbled jaggery and 2 tablespoons chopped dates.
        
        tamarind and jaggery powder added<br>
        
        4. Now add 1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder, 1 teaspoon chaat masala and salt as per taste. You can also use a mix of black salt and pink salt or regular salt. I personally prefer to use either black salt or edible rock salt.
        
        spices and chaat masala added<br>
        
        5. Add ⅓ cup water and grind to a smooth consistency.

        6. Remove the chutney to a bowl or a small pan.

        7. Now add ½ cup water in the grinder jar and swirl the jar so that the chutney at the sides of the jar gets mixed with the water.

        8. Add this water to the bowl containing the chutney.

        9. Then add ½ to ¾ cup water. You can add less or more water depending on the consistency you want. But do not add too much water as then the taste and flavor of the spiced water reduces. Also check the taste and if required you can add some more jaggery or salt as required.
        
        water added to green chutney<br>
        10. Mix very well. Cover the pan and refrigerate the pani. Before refrigerating you can also add 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of salted boondi.
        
        
        Boondi also gives a good taste. It can also be made at home or purchased easily from grocery stores.

        Making potato filling for pani puri
        11. Boil 2 to 3 medium-sized potatoes. You can boil or steam the potatoes in a pan, instant pot or stovetop pressure cooker adding water as required.
        
        When warm, peel them and chop them into small cubes. You can also add some steamed or boiled moong sprouts. Some finely chopped onions can also be added. I have added 1 small-sized finely chopped onion.
        
        mashed potatoes in a bowl<br>
        
        12. Add 1 to 1.5 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves.
        
        coriander leaves added to potatoes<br>
        
        13. Then add ¼ teaspoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon chaat masala and 1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder. Also add salt as per taste.
        
        spices added to potatoes<br>
        14. Stir and mix very well. Keep aside.

        Assembling Pani Puri<br>
        15. Keep everything ready before you start assembling the pani puri. The potato filling, pooris and the spiced water.
        
        In the photos below, I have made sweet tamarind dates chutney, just to show the assembling. 
        
        First crack the top of the puri with a spoon or with your fingers or thumb. Then stuff the potato filling in the puri with a spoon.
        
        Add a few teaspoons of sweet chutney or as per your choice. The addition of sweet chutney is optional for the pani recipe shared in this post.
        
        serving and preparing pani puri<br>
        16. Then add a few teaspoons of the green spiced water or as per your choice.
        
        adding green chutney in the pani puri<br>
        
        17. The pani puri is ready to serve. Pop in your mouth, eat every bite and enjoy the burst of various flavors and textures. Make sure to eat them immediately as you prepare each puri.
        
        They have to be had immediately. Or else the puris become soggy. To make a Mumbai style pani puri recipe, use ragda or moong sprouts as the filling.</p>
