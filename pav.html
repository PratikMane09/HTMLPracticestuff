    <h1>Pav Bhaji With So Much Butter</h1>

        <h9>Ingredients Notes</h9>
        <li>Butter: I cannot imagine my pav bhaji is made/served without butter. To get the best taste (when we talk about the authentic taste), butter is an essential ingredient. Bhaji is cooked in butter and it is topped with a dollop of butter before serving. But if you are health conscious then you can reduce the amount or substitute with oil.</li>
        <li>Pav bhaji masala: It is the second essential ingredient here, so it has to be good in quality and taste. I recommend using the Everest brand. MDH comes after that. I have a really bad experience with Badshah. Or if you have time you can make it at home by following this pav bhaji masala powder recipe.</li> 
        <li>Potatoes: It is the essential ingredient to make the base of thick, creamy bhaji. So do not skip or reduce the amount of potatoes here.</li>
        
<li>Veggies: The combination of cauliflower, carrot, peas, and potatoes is the standard veggie combo for authentic tasting bhaji. Do not have fresh ones in the refrigerator, you can use frozen vegetable mix (which contains carrot, peas, corn, and beans). But I would add sure add potatoes.</li></ul>

        <li>Meanwhile, onion mixture is cooking, add tomatoes to the same food processor jar. </li>
        <li>Make it chunky puree. It does not require smooth puree.</li>
        <li>Now onion mixture is cooked, you can see onions become soft and translucent.</li>
        <li> Add red chili powder and remaining salt.</li>
        <liMix well.</li>

        <li>Cover with lid, keep the vent to sealing. cancel the saute mode. Pressure cook on manual (high pressure) for 6 minutes. You can let NPR (natural pressure release). If in rush QPR (quick pressure release) after 5-10 minutes. Once pin drops open the lid.</li>

        <li>Add pav bhaji masala.</li>
        <li>Using the potato masher, start mashing and mixing. Alternately you can use a hand blender. But be careful not to make pasty smooth puree. It has to be slightly chunky.</li>
         <li>Now turn the saute mode back on and simmer for 2-3 minutes. This simmering time may vary depending on how watery your bhaji is.</li>

        
         <li>While it is simmering add remaining butter and lemon juice. Stir well.</li>
         <li>Lastly, garnish with chopped cilantro</li>

<h6>Toasting Ladi Pav To Serve With:</h6><p>
    1) Heat the pan on medium heat. Meantime cut the pav into half (not all the way through, keep the two slices intact). Once the pan is hot, add little butter, add pav bhaji masala, mix and spread in the pan.

<br>2) Place the pav on it. While the bottom side is getting toasted, apply butter on top.

<br>3) Once the bottom is light brown, fil with spatula and toast the other side.

<br>4) Close the pav, remove from the pan, and serve with bhaji.
